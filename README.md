# Recursive-function-pt2
The purpose of this program is to test 5 recursive functions that operate different task.
The function (printValues) takes in a integer along with a index that indicates the 10th value of the number. The function will recure untill each number of the integer is printed followed by a space.
The first function (printLongFwd) uses the printValues function and recursivly prints each digit in a number in incremental order.
The second function (printLongBwd) uses the printValues function and recursivly prints each digit in a number in decremental order.
The third function (binarySearch) searches for a given value in an array recursivly using a binary search algorithm.
The fourth function (printSubSets) prints out every possible subset of an array of numbers using recursion.
The fifth function (multiply) multipys two values using recursion.
